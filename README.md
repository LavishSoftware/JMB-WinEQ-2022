# JMB-WinEQ-2022
WinEQ 2022 is a Joe Multiboxer agent implementation of WinEQ 2, for multiboxing EverQuest.

Work is in progress!

# Overview

**WinEQ 2022**, an agent for [Joe Multiboxer](https://joemultiboxer.com), is **now available for testing** via <https://github.com/LavishSoftware/JMB-WinEQ-2022>. Here's a direct link to the download! <https://github.com/LavishSoftware/JMB-WinEQ-2022/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>

**WinEQ 2022 can import your WinEQ 2 settings and manage launching and switching between EverQuest 1 windows!** Some of the features have not been fully implemented yet, but the basics are all in!

**WinEQ 2022 is open source!** While Joe Multiboxer itself is not open source, agents are! Anyone with a little tech savvy can make changes, implement new features, and even share with others.

* **Tip:** The `Basic Core Agents` are typically recommended with Joe Multiboxer. However, **all you need to install is `WinEQ 2022`**. Any other agent you install will make it do things you aren't used to happening, including dynamic Window Layouts (`Basic Window Layout`) or putting numbers on windows (`Basic Highlighter`) and so on. :)
